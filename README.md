# ANGULAR FROTEND | Contacts
In this technical project I made an Angular Frotend. about Contacts using Reactive Forms.

For the data, I have a JSON, and to use it as an API, I used json-server. To setup de API, run the command `npm i json-server` in the project to install the package, and just run the command `npm run serverAPI` to setup up the API.
